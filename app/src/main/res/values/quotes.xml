        <item>What is modern art but the attempt to pinpoint vague, incorporeal, inexpressible sensations? What is modern art, I would add, but the most solemn pile of nonsense that ever appeared on Earth?</item>
        <item>In the future, I kind of like the idea of doing music for film. I think that would be a nice job. I've always liked the sound aspect in movies. I guess once I have more instruments under my belt, it could be something I could do.</item>

        <item>Creativity is what helps me escape a lot of my inner demons.</item>
        <item>Sigmund Freud was the apostle of disbelief. He was the one who made psychoanalysis a part of our culture, and in so doing he kicked out a flying buttress that had been essential for holding up our cathedral of faith.</item>
        <item>In my own recent String Trio I attempt to superimpose two quite different sets of formal strategies, both of which, ultimately, refer back to historical precedent.</item>

        <item>Respect is one of the greatest expressions of love.</item>
        <item>I always enjoy the job and the work that I do, because that's the condition that I attach in accepting any job. This way, I can really work and dedicate myself to the institution for achieving the goal which I believe is a noble one.</item>
        <item>People assume that science is a very cold sort of profession, whereas writing novels is a warm and fuzzy intuitive thing. But in fact, they are not at all different.</item>
        <item>Many times I sit back and say, 'I can't believe that this is my life!' Other times, I feel self-satisfied. I mean, there's a lot to be proud and thankful for but, nonetheless, it's just a life!</item>
        <item>Find out who you are and be that person. That's what your soul was put on this Earth to be. Find that truth, live that truth and everything else will come.</item>
        <item>I can write a program that lets you break the copy protection on a music file. But I can't write a program that solders new connections onto a chip for you.</item>

        <item>It is my goal to love everyone. I hate no one. Regardless of their race, religion, their proclivities, the desire of their heart and how they want to live their life and the decisions that they make. I can even respect people's decisions and lifestyle choices just as I hope they have the courtesy to respect my decisions and my choices.</item>
        <item>You can be still and still moving. Content even in your discontent.</item>
        <item>Not only don't I know who I am, but I'm very suspicious of people who do know who they are. I am sometimes ten or twelve people a day, and sometimes four or five people an hour!</item>
        <item>The only way that we can reduce our financial dependence on the inflow of funds from the rest of the world is to reduce our trade deficit.</item>

        <item>After I've sent my revised draft to my agent and editor, they suggest more improvement sand again, this revision phase can take anywhere from a few hours to a few months.</item>
        <item>In the eighth grade I found I had a voice for opera, so I followed that path a little, but my impulse has always been an actor. I have always liked cinema, and let's face it, opera singers are just bad actors! I didn't want to translate myself in that direction.</item>
        <item>When I first started cooking, I was very much an intuitive cook when it came to taste, but that didn't mean I didn't want to know why some things worked and why others did not. My interest took me to culinary school.</item>
        <item>In the end, it is because the media are driven by the power and wealth of private individuals that they turn private lives into public spectacles. If every private life is now potentially public property, it is because private property has undermined public responsibility.</item>
        <item>Obviously I have a capacity for feeling extreme anxiety, and there are people out there who don't. I'm to some extent rather jealous of them.</item>

        <item>I think ultimately if you have a very high expectation of your audience and you know exactly what it is you're trying to express through the medium of film, there will always be an audience for you.</item>
        <item>We have long possessed the art of war and the science of war, which have been evolved in the minutest detail.</item>

        <item>I will not accept if nominated, and will not serve if elected.</item>
        <item>I think when money starts to corrupt journalism, it undermines the journalism, and it undermines the credibility of the product, and you end up not succeeding.</item>
        <item>I just don't know how to deal with so many people giving me that much affection. I never had that in my life.</item>
        <item>When time and space and change converge, we find place. We arrive in Place when we resolve things. Place is peace of mind and understanding. Place is knowledge of self. Place is resolution.</item>

        <item>Music critics are part of the world, and I am part of the world.</item>

        <item>You see, in America, it's quite standard for an actor to sign, at the beginning of a series, for five or seven years. The maximum any British agent will allow you to have over an actor is three years.</item>
        <item>I think a story should take as long to tell as it is appropriate to that particular story.</item>
        <item>In writing, I search for believability, simplicity and emotional impact.</item>
        <item>The trouble with born-again Christians is that they are an even bigger pain the second time around.</item>
        <item>Performers are so vulnerable. They're frightened of humiliation, sure their work will be crap. I try to make an environment where it's warm, where it's OK to fail - a kind of home, I suppose.</item>
        <item>I loved working on Of Mice and Men. It was a wonderful group of people. John Malkovich is to me one of the best actors around right now-and a lot of fun to work with.</item>
        <item>It is clear to me that people often want incompatible things. They want danger and excitement on the one hand, and safety and security on the other, and often simultaneously. Contradictory desires mean that life can never be wholly satisfying or without frustration.</item>
        <item>I'm at a point in my life where I have something solid now. I'm a peaceful person, and I want to be surrounded by peace no matter what I'm doing.</item>
        <item>What is a wife and what is a harlot? What is a church and what is a theatre? are they two and not one? Can they exist separate? Are not religion and politics the same thing? Brotherhood is religion. O demonstrations of reason dividing families in cruelty and pride!</item>
        <item>My path has not been determined. I shall have more experiences and pass many more milestones.</item>
        <item>Sometimes it's hard to tell if a joke is working or not for the first couple of minutes.</item>
        <item>When I'm in New York, I just want to walk down the street and feel this thing, like I'm in a movie.</item>
        <item>I knew the profanity used up and down my street would not go over the air… So I trained myself to say 'Holy Cow' instead.</item>
        <item>My parents did great and provided well, and gave all their kids personal, moral, ethical values, not a belief that we were entitled to something.</item>
        <item>The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.</item>
        <item>I've tried not to get sucked into the Hollywood hierarchy system. Personally, I don't like it when people are deferential to me because I'm an established filmmaker. It's a blue-collar sensibility.</item>
        <item>Modernism in other arts brought extreme difficulty. In poetry, the characteristic difficulty imported under the name of modernism was obscurity. But obscurity could just as easily be a quality of metrical as of free verse.</item>
        <item>We may give without loving, but we cannot love without giving.</item>
        <item>The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.</item>
        <item>Each has his own tree of ancestors, but at the top of all sits Probably Arboreal.</item>
        <item>On 'Heartbreaker,' I had to sing those songs. I drank the way I did those songs. I ate the way I did those songs. I communicated the way I did those songs. With 'Gold,' I was trying to prove something to myself. I wanted to invent a modern classic.</item>
        <item>I have learned to hate all traitors, and there is no disease that I spit on more than treachery.</item>
        <item>I'm finding that I'm working with more and more Latino artists, and that's exciting.</item>
        <item>You cannot find yourself by going into the past. You can find yourself by coming into the present.</item>
        <item>My reputation grows with every failure.</item>
        <item>Don't try to 'fix' the child's boredom - rather, let the child find his or her inner resources.</item>
        <item>Anyone who's read my 'Terror in the Skies' series knows that I have not been writing with an eye toward approval from any government agency.</item>
        <item>There's a time and place for the Kindle, and I own one now and have books on it that I don't otherwise have. But I don't find that my hand reaches out for it the way it does for a trade paperback, or (in the middle of the night) for the iPod Touch.</item>
        <item>This program that the Republican majority has taken us toward as a country is leading us to fiscal bankruptcy.</item>
        <item>fashion,  n.  A despot whom the wise ridicule and obey.</item>
        <item>He that cannot reason is a fool. He that will not is a bigot. He that dare not is a slave.</item>
        <item>Don't tell your kids you had an easy birth or they won't respect you. For years I used to wake up my daughter and say, 'Melissa you ripped me to shreds. Now go back to sleep.'.</item>
        <item>There is no mistaking the dismay on the face of a writer who has just heard that his brain child is a deformed idiot.</item>
        <item>I would eat fruitcake if there'd been a nuclear war and I'd run out of canned goods.</item>
        <item>You know, let's put it this way, if all the people in Hollywood who have had plastic surgery, if they went on vacation, there wouldn't be a person left in town.</item>
        <item>My parents were very active in the Civil Rights Movement. My father was a Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) worker; my mother was a secretary with the Panthers.</item>
        <item>We believe that government works for the benefit of private life, and not the other way around.</item>
        <item>English should be our official language. Reading and speaking English are requirements to become a citizen.</item>
        <item>I knew I could sing. That one thing I did believe in was that I could sing, but then constantly getting rejected, it started to get me down. But my voice was always there and my dream and my ambition was always there when I went through bad times.</item>
        <item>Accusations are made directly to Rome about theologians from persons who are not theologians. Some of these accusations are anonymous. The local bishop should be the one to relate to theologians to determine orthodoxy.</item>
        <item>You have to be vigorous. That's the only way you are going to get it because everybody has dreams and everybody has goals, but the only people who achieve them are the ones that go after it and don't take no for an answer.</item>
        <item>Gambling is a disease of barbarians superficially civilized.</item>
        <item>Success is important only to the extent that it puts one in a position to do more things one likes to do.</item>
        <item>Love, whether newly born, or aroused from a deathlike slumber, must always create sunshine, filling the heart so full of radiance, this it overflows upon the outward world.</item>
        <item>To me, religion is an agreement between a group of people about what God is. Spirituality is a one-on-one relationship.</item>
        <item>If I did only one thing at a time I'd think I was wasting my time. If, for example, I only wrote novels I would feel like a charlatan and a fraud.</item>
        <item>I guess I really always wanted to act. When I was seven, I actually had the opportunity to come out to California. I've always really loved playing a part, playing a character and being someone else.</item>
        <item>The ultimate aim of the ego is not to see something, but to be something.</item>
        <item>It doesn't matter if the water is cold or warm if you're going to have to wade through it anyway.</item>
        <item>I'm friends with a lot of actresses, but my 'SNL' friends are my closest. The experience of working there is something of a battleground, a great one, but complicated. I think there's a deep connection for having survived that workplace.</item>
        <item>Everybody has a high point and a lot goes into that: timing, situation, general consciousness.</item>
        <item>No matter what you do, you can act your heart out, but people will always say, 'Oh, Julie Adams - 'Creature from the Black Lagoon.''</item>
        <item>A cloudy day is no match for a sunny disposition.</item>
        <item>I think especially in a world where you have so little say about what goes on in your life, or in the politics of the world around you, it is wonderful to go into that studio, and tell yourself what to do.</item>
        <item>Life is a song - sing it. Life is a game - play it. Life is a challenge - meet it. Life is a dream - realize it. Life is a sacrifice - offer it. Life is love - enjoy it.</item>
        <item>The kids out there want something they can relate to, something that's real; most of that whiny stuff isn't real. The cheesy pop songs just bore me to death.</item>
        <item>You can't create in a vacuum. Life gives you the material and dreams can propel new beginnings.</item>
        <item>A lot of times, you feel like you're walking on eggshells in a creative environment, because everyone's having to watch out for egos so much of the time.</item>
        <item>I think of New Yorkers as not taking the time to talk to someone they don't know.</item>
        <item>My relationship with God has gotten so much stronger. He's always had his hand on me. He always guided me. I didn't always go where he wanted me to go. But He always had me. Now that I'm actually listening and being obedient, life is so much better.</item>
        <item>Talk doesn't cook rice.</item>
        <item>For a lot of my childhood, I didn't want to direct movies because I didn't really know what directing was.</item>
        <item>I am doing things that are true to me. The only thing I have a problem with is being labeled.</item>
        <item>Some people seem to fade away but then when they are truly gone, it's like they didn't fade away at all.</item>
        <item>When you don't know what you believe, everything becomes an argument. Everything is debatable. But when you stand for something, decisions are obvious.</item>
        <item>The secret of business is to know something that nobody else knows.</item>
        <item>If you can't believe a little in what you see on the screen, it's not worth wasting your time on cinema.</item>
        <item>Anybody who has interacted with me will definitely find me to be a chirpy person.</item>
        <item>I don't just come from a musical family, but from a musical community.</item>
        <item>The third-rate mind is only happy when it is thinking with the majority. The second-rate mind is only happy when it is thinking with the minority. The first-rate mind is only happy when it is thinking.</item>
        <item>It's unfortunate nine years were in between - you can't take that time back; you can't undo it.</item>
        <item>There was a lot of music in our home. Mom played piano in church and gave piano lessons.</item>
        <item>Young readers have to be entertained. No child reads fiction because they think it's going to make them a better person.</item>
        <item>I remember once having to stop performing when I thought an elderly man a few rows back from the front was actually going to die because he was laughing so hard.</item>
        <item>The 'Gossip Girl' idea and ideologies, like, they sort of encourage this certain kind of, like, materialism and superficiality that isn't, I would say, the best thing in the world.</item>
        <item>Don't blame the marketing department. The buck stops with the chief executive.</item>
        <item>Obamanomics, his imposition of European-style socialism, is not working for African-Americans. It is not working for Latinos and African-Americans.</item>
        <item>It is by acts and not by ideas that people live.</item>
        <item>Few men have virtue to withstand the highest bidder.</item>
        <item>With my plays, when the lights go down, at least the audience isn't thinking, 'Oh, God, two more hours of this.'</item>
        <item>You can't build an adaptable organization without adaptable people - and individuals change only when they have to, or when they want to.</item>
        <item>Outsourcing and globalization of manufacturing allows companies to reduce costs, benefits consumers with lower cost goods and services, causes economic expansion that reduces unemployment, and increases productivity and job creation.</item>
        <item>I haven't read the 'Twilight' books. But it's everywhere so I feel like I know it. Edward, Bella, Jacob, etc. but… I haven't read them.</item>
        <item>Parents have become so convinced that educators know what is best for their children that they forget that they themselves are really the experts.</item>
        <item>For those that fly may fight again, Which he can never do that's slain.</item>
        <item>In America, sex is an obsession, in other parts of the world it's a fact.</item>
        <item>But, you know, I just want to play well and have fun playing well.</item>
        <item>History shows that people often do cast their votes for amorphous reasons-the most powerful among them being the need for change. Just ask Bill Clinton.</item>
        <item>I have always loved to use fear, to take it and comprehend it and make it work and consolidate a situation where I was afraid and take it whole and work from there.</item>
        <item>My father would tell anyone who would listen that this dentist thing he was doing was not his passion; cinematography was.</item>
        <item>Nothing defines humans better than their willingness to do irrational things in the pursuit of phenomenally unlikely payoffs. This is the principle behind lotteries, dating, and religion.</item>
        <item>He sleeps well who knows not that he sleeps ill.</item>
        <item>Writing with you is the only thing that keeps me alive.</item>
        <item>One must be fond of people and trust them if one is not to make a mess of life.</item>
        <item>CBS fought very hard on this because it believed and believes that there's a principle at stake here. The principle is that Dan Rather doesn't work for the police, and that people that speak to Dan Rather understand that he's a journalist and not a police agent.</item>
        <item>I spent the afternoon musing on Life. If you come to think of it, what a queer thing Life is! So unlike anything else, don't you know, if you see what I mean.</item>
        <item>I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning how to sail my ship.</item>
        <item>I think that in the discussion of natural problems we ought to begin not with the Scriptures, but with experiments, and demonstrations.</item>
        <item>I love winners when they cry, losers when they try.</item>
        <item>It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.</item>
        <item>I read the script and try not to bring anything personal into it. I make notes, talk to the director and we decide what kinds of shades should be in the character.</item>
        <item>It's a constant battle for everybody, but you need to be happy with yourself.</item>
        <item>Now we are raising the debt limit 3 times, up to $8 trillion, so that our children and our grandchildren will have to pay for the cost of our expenditures.</item>
        <item>Proust, my big inspiration for 'Goon Squad,' uses music a lot in his novel, both in terms of plot and structure. I liked the idea of doing the same thing, which is one reason I structured 'Goon Squad' as a record album, with an A side and a B side, that's built around the contrasting sounds of the individual numbers in it.</item>

        <item>There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning.</item>
        <item>In a home school, the kid does 95% of the work. But in a school system, since it's an indoctrination system, a teacher has to do 95% of the work.</item>
        <item>Ever since I was a kid, I've always thought it very important to be happy inside. There's a lot of bad things happening in the world, but it's important to try to stay happy and appreciate what you've got, and don't look externally for the happiness.</item>
        <item>No, and in fact I get a bit frustrated, because I'm actually quite good at one-liners, and I've had hundreds of them over the years, and they sink without trace, and I get very frustrated. Every party conference I really work on the speeches, and I always have two or three things I'm quite proud of, and no one ever remembers them.</item>
        <item>I love Alton Brown's show 'Good Eats,' about the chemistry of food. It's really thoughtful.</item>
        <item>You know, sometimes if you work - if you do a lot of takes and you work long hours, for me, at least, there is a delirium that starts kicking in on the fifteenth hour, and that can help. Below the just thirteenth hour is where I have a concern, because everybody's so tired.</item>
        <item>I want you to like me, but I don't care if you don't.</item>
        <item>I think it's a great time to put out quality work, and it will speak for itself.

        <item>I try to work out with my personal trainer for an hour, four times a week - we mainly concentrate on weights and running. If I'm on the road I sometimes do DVD work-outs in my hotel room - P90X and Insanity are a couple of my favourites.</item>

        <item>Women are usually only interesting to studio executives when they are fecund, between the ages of 15 and 30.

        <item>I like looking nice, but I always put comfort over fashion. I don't find thin girls attractive; be happy and healthy. I've never had a problem with the way I look. I'd rather have lunch with my friends than go to a gym.</item>

And that's what meditation is about, that's what, in many ways, sports are about.</item>

        <item>It wasn't my tennis that made me lose, it was a lot of different things going on, high drama, high emotion.</item>
        <item>I got involved in lots of different areas round about 2007, 2008. Just working with lots of different people and stretching myself in different ways. I was working on art projects and working with other writers, just doing bits and pieces, trying to keep busy.</item>
        <item>I thought I'd be doing theater, really. That's all I had experience with growing up. I mean, I saw movies and television, but I don't think I really connected at a young age that that was acting, that that was part of the profession.</item>
        <item>I don't react to a tragic happening any more. I took so many bad things as a kid and some people think I don't care about anything. It's just too hard for me to get emotional. I can't cry no more.</item>

        <item>At her birthday, my seven-year-old daughter will say that she wants these big cakes and certain expensive toys as presents, and I can't say no to her. It would just break my heart. But when I was little, for birthdays we just played outside and we were happy if we got any cake.</item>
        <item>I think if there's a great depression there might be some hope.</item>
        <item>I think women should have insight as to how men think. Just like men should have insight into how women think.</item>

        <item>We are all faced with a series of great opportunities - brilliantly disguised as insoluble problems.</item>

        <item>Everyone spends their lives trying to balance their world between good and evil.</item>
        <item>We are all hungry and thirsty for concrete images. Abstract art will have been good for one thing: to restore its exact virginity to figurative art.</item>
        <item>I'd like to help other kids with dyslexia, because I'm dyslexic. It was very hard, and I know that what I went through, other kids are going through.</item>
        <item>I'm hardly digging trenches for a living. I'm getting to tap into my boyhood fantasies of being a larger-than-life character.</item>

        <item>I'm Jamaican, man. I'm Jamaican first. You gotta understand that's where I'm from. That's home. That you can never take away from me. I'm a Jamaican-born Canadian sprinter.</item>
        <item>Our nature hardly allows us to have enough of anything without having too much.</item>
        <item>For me, the acting part - and I have to say it makes me a little worried about my own psychological make-up - is that I just love to hide in other characters. I don't like to get up in front of people and talk as Kathy Baker. But as soon as you say 'action,' I'm lost in that character.</item>
        <item>There are plenty of studies that have shown that depression is associated with decreased immunity. So I want to harness all of the positive emotional energy I can in a patient to get better.</item>
        <item>The big missing part of the jig-saw is to get the assembly back up and running here in Northern Ireland, to get shared government back in business, that is my objective, and we await the IRA statement to see if this will trigger a new dawn.</item>
        <item>The majority of men meet with failure because of their lack of persistence in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail.</item>
        <item>I have a passion to do theater.</item>
        <item>People say 'Women's Wear' is a scandalous, gossipy publication. Sure we have gossip; we also have some very, very solid business stories. We are a creation of this business, which is fast, mean, tough, sometimes artistic, sometimes horrible.</item>

        <item>Fettucini alfredo is macaroni and cheese for adults.</item>
        <item>I give 110% while I am working. I know I do, because I have been doing this since I was nine. This is a way of life for me. So whether it be successful or not is not in my hands. I still do my job, the best I can.</item>
        <item>I find this mortifying to admit, but I have one of those balls that helps my posture. They're hard to sit on, so it stops me from sitting too long… I also wear a pair of 3M(TM) PELTOR(TM) Optime(TM) II Ear Muffs. They're the same ones that people wear on the tarmac among the planes - noise blockers.</item>

        <item>The scary thing is a dramatic erosion of American position in the world - its economic, military position, as well as America's influence. Obama is not the man at the wheel desperately trying to conserve American power, influence and wealth. For ideological reasons, he wants the slipping to continue.

        <item>Motherhood is a great honor and privilege, yet it is also synonymous with servanthood. Every day women are called upon to selflessly meet the needs of their families.

        <item>When performance exceeds ambition, the overlap is called success.</item>
        <item>Let me completely condemn these sickening scenes; scenes of looting, scenes of vandalism, scenes of thieving, scenes of people attacking police, of people even attacking firefighters. This is criminality pure and simple and it has to be confronted.</item>
        <item>Education is the best friend. An educated person is respected everywhere. Education beats the beauty and the youth.</item>
        <item>Most powerful is he who has himself in his own power.</item>
        <item>Middle age occurs when you are too young to take up golf and too old to rush up to the net.</item>

        <item>Our company sells about five to six million pounds of sausage a year. We sell it retail and to restaurants. We've got all kinds of products.</item>
        <item>Leadership is about doing what you know is right - even when a growing din of voices around you is trying to convince you to accept what you know to be wrong.</item>
        <item>All religions worthy of the name are now making great efforts to purify their doctrines and return to their original standpoint, all except Christianity! You surely know that the nineteenth century Christianity is not the religion taught by Christ. Christ's religion has been changed and corrupted.</item>
        <item>Evolution isn't true, because if we evolved from monkeys, how can they still be here?</item>
        <item>As long as I'm not living out of a suitcase, I'm happy.</item>
        <item>Starting out to make money is the greatest mistake in life. Do what you feel you have a flair for doing, and if you are good enough at it, the money will come.</item>
        <item>Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.</item>
        <item>I think as time goes by you'll get female comics who are weirder - you'll get a female Mighty Boosh.</item>
        <item>As a financial historian, I was quite isolated in Oxford - British historians are supposed to write about kings - so the quality of intellectual life in my field is much higher at Harvard. The students work harder there.</item>
        <item>Airplanes may kill you, but they ain't likely to hurt you.</item>
        <item>I literally have people go, 'Oh my God, you're the Pink Power Ranger' and I'm like, 'I do other things!' But, you know, it's so cool! I saved the world for a year.</item>
        <item>America's criminal justice system isn't known for rehabilitation. I'm not sure that, as a society, we are even interested in that concept anymore.</item>
        <item>We Jews have a secret weapon in our struggle with the Arabs; we have no place to go.</item>
        <item>I arrived from Harvard, where I had studied philosophy and the history of ideas, with a bias toward literature and formal thought.</item>
        <item>I think American guys tend to be a bit more forward, a bit more chatty and open than the Brits. The Brits seem to have a darker sense of humor, though I have met some Americans who have adopted bits of the British dry sense of humor as well.</item>
        <item>I love Mickey Mouse more than any woman I have ever known.</item>
        <item>My experience as a young actor on network television was that I couldn't make it work. I was drowning as an actor.</item>
        <item>Tape is wonderful at preserving evidence - fingerprints, hairs, fibers. Tape preserves this, especially on the sticky side, even if the body's been out there for a year.</item>
        <item>A monopoly on the means of communication may define a ruling elite more precisely than the celebrated Marxian formula of monopoly in the means of production.</item>
        <item>Caresses, expressions of one sort or another, are necessary to the life of the affections as leaves are to the life of a tree. If they are wholly restrained, love will die at the roots.</item>
        <item>It's also a more personal medium. It seems to go directly to one's brain. There are no pictures to distract.</item>
        <item>Faced with the collapse of Iraq into something like Lebanon - or worse, Somalia - the Bush administration opted for a new counterinsurgency strategy. Violence was reduced because, for the first time since the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, Iraqis felt that there was a force capable of dominating the situation and ensuring basic order.</item>
        <item>Life is without meaning. You bring the meaning to it. The meaning of life is whatever you ascribe it to be. Being alive is the meaning.</item>
        <item>Don't follow any advice, no matter how good, until you feel as deeply in your spirit as you think in your mind that the counsel is wise.</item>
        <item>Many young people now end a discussion with the supposedly definitive and unanswerable statement that such is their opinion, and their opinion is just as valid as anyone else's. The fact is that our opinion on an infinitely large number of questions is not worth having, because everyone is infinitely ignorant.</item>
        <item>I started working with brain sensing tech in labs over a decade ago and was immediately fascinated by the potential to help people peer into the workings and behaviors of their own minds.</item>
        <item>Man is a history-making creature who can neither repeat his past nor leave it behind.</item>
        <item>That's how we grew up - kinda like Pops would put his drums, his percussion and instruments into the car and we would just go to a facility in the Bay Area and he would say to us, 'You think we have it bad? There are people worse off than we are. Let's go give back to the kids.' And that's how we grew up.</item>
        <item>The end of law is not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge freedom. For in all the states of created beings capable of law, where there is no law, there is no freedom.</item>

        <item>You think dogs will not be in heaven? I tell you, they will be there long before any of us.</item>
        <item>I'm a goal setter, but in broad strokes. I don't have a by-October-2009-I-want-to-be-here plan. All I do is work with an element of challenge and an element of enjoyment. With that, anything can happen.</item>
        <item>Perfection is immutable. But for things imperfect, change is the way to perfect them.</item>
        <item>Life is God's novel. Let him write it.</item>

        <item>Poetry, especially traditional Iranian poetry, is very good at looking at things from a number of different angles simultaneously.</item>
        <item>Willie Wells, Ray Dandridge, Leon Day, Buck Leonard, Quincy Troupe, Satchel Paige - earlier than when he was called up - Oscar Charleston and Josh Gibson. You see what kind of talent we had, and guys in the majors knew it too.</item>
        <item>I don't know why you use a fancy French word like detente when there's a good English phrase for it - cold war.</item>
        <item>One thing I'd like to do is angel investing in small companies. That's what's exciting, and if you are lucky to have a bit of money, you can take those risks.</item>
        <item>Snakes are just very instinctive to me. I've been playing with snakes since before I could walk. It doesn't matter where or what it is, from the biggest to the most venomous.</item>
        <item>Every man is the builder of a temple, called his body, to the god he worships, after a style purely his own, nor can he get off by hammering marble instead. We are all sculptors and painters, and our material is our own flesh and blood and bones. Any nobleness begins at once to refine a man's features, any meanness or sensuality to imbrute them.</item>
        <item>I mean, what is music anyway? It's a form of communication - at least for me it is. And that's why I play the kind of music that I think - that I hope - can communicate with people.</item>
        <item>Perseverance is a great element of success. If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate, you are sure to wake up somebody.</item>
        <item>Obviously, the greater the length of a war the higher is likely to be the number of casualties in it on either side.</item>
        <item>Being on the road is kind of lonely.</item>
        <item>The spirit, the will to win, and the will to excel, are the things that endure. These qualities are so much more important than the events that occur.</item>
        <item>Leadership cannot just go along to get along. Leadership must meet the moral challenge of the day.</item>
        <item>To wear your heart on your sleeve isn't a very good plan; you should wear it inside, where it functions best.</item>
        <item>Classical tragedy was the war between good and evil. We wanted evil to be defeated and good to be victorious. But the battle in modern tragedy is between good and good. And no matter which side wins, we'll still be heartbroken.</item>
        <item>As long as I have a want, I have a reason for living. Satisfaction is death.</item>
        <item>Love cannot endure indifference. It needs to be wanted. Like a lamp, it needs to be fed out of the oil of another's heart, or its flame burns low.</item>
        <item>I love mankind; it's people I can't stand.</item>
        <item>However, if we examine the Canadian scene closely enough, we can see signs of this physical and spiritual rot settling into a number of our Canadian urban centres with a troubling spill-over into many of our more rural areas.</item>
        <item>For love is immortality.</item>
        <item>I believe in large families: every woman should have at least three husbands.</item>
        <item>I never grew up thinking the goal in life was to be a millionaire. All the way through college, I had a part-time job. I worked hard to get the things that you need at that age.</item>
        <item>Being on the run, having to change the way that you do business, being unable to plan in a safe and secure environment, always looking over your shoulder, knowing that some day somebody's going to knock on your door and it's going to be your last.</item>
        <item>I never wear mascara; I laugh until I cry too often.</item>
        <item>But we had a pretty diversified portfolio of businesses around the world and things tended to offset each other. But one or two years ago, we had a lot of things happening at the same time.</item>
        <item>When I was little, I didn't really travel - from the suburbs to Paris was already a journey. I had a foreigner's eye on the city, and I still enjoy that point of view. Then there's the fact that one of the things that touches me most is injustice.</item>
        <item>We have to raise the consciousness; the only way poets can change the world is to raise the consciousness of the general populace.</item>
        <item>I think it's really terrifying that a country based on the foundations and ideals of God, is now systematically removing God from everything. Everything!</item>
        <item>It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.</item>
        <item>They wanted me to do Scream 2, and I hate talking about movies I turned down, because it sounds judgmental. There's nothing wrong with horror movies. I enjoy watching them. The main reason I turn a part down is if I think I won't be good.</item>
        <item>Actually I think Art lies in both directions - the broad strokes, big picture but on the other hand the minute examination of the apparently mundane. Seeing the whole world in a grain of sand, that kind of thing.</item>
        <item>Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature, but he is a thinking reed.</item>
        <item>Good character is not formed in a week or a month. It is created little by little, day by day. Protracted and patient effort is needed to develop good character.</item>
        <item>I am waiting for them to prove that God is really American.</item>
        <item>We've always had a love for other places outside the US. I would be right with him. Now that Michael's been vindicated, we all have to be careful… you never know what someone's plotting and planning.</item>

        <item>One is born to be a great dancer.</item>
        <item>What each must seek in his life never was on land or sea. It is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience, something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else.</item>
        <item>There is no success without hardship.</item>
        <item>Music is for people. The word 'pop' is simply short for popular. It means that people like it. I'm just a normal jerk who happens to make music. As long as my brain and fingers work, I'm cool.</item>
        <item>I would not have done much differently, but I would have loved to have done everything better. The truth is, I think I was just getting warmed up when the era ended.</item>
        <item>One must never look for happiness: one meets it by the way.</item>
        <item>I mean the idea of this is that it's a good thing for the public to hear interviews like this and that there will be an inevitable amount of fewer interviews if people that the press talks to wind up thinking, well, it's not really a CBS correspondent.</item>
        <item>Studies show that children of divorced parents can have outcomes as positive as those coming from intact homes, provided the father remains financially supportive and active in his children's lives.</item>

        <item>And whenever I'm in a situation where I'm wearing the same as 600 other people and doing the same thing as 600 other people, looking back, I always found ways to make myself different, whether it be having a red lining inside of my jacket, having red shoes, it hasn't changed.</item>
        <item>Living at risk is jumping off the cliff and building your wings on the way down.</item>
        <item>What I fell in love with as a child was 'My Fair Lady,' 'Funny Face,' 'American in Paris,' and 'Singin' in the Rain.' Just perfect movies to me and I was dancing. I started ballet when I was three. And I fell in love with those movies and fell in love with Audrey Hepburn and Leslie Caron.</item>
        <item>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</item>
        <item>I did not see myself as a leading lady. I thought I was really funny-looking and I would never be the lead, and I certainly would never do film or television. I wanted to do theater. I wanted to be the grand dame of the American stage.</item>
        <item>We should have scant notion of the gardens of these New England colonists in the seventeenth century were it not for a cheerful traveller named John Josselyn, a man of everyday tastes and much inquisitiveness, and the pleasing literary style which comes from directness, and an absence of self-consciousness.</item>
        <item>Did I say that the President's entire job is image management? Of course not.</item>
        <item>Most of my life I've had long periods of feeling down and lost. That's why every five years or so I've smashed my life to pieces and started again.</item>
        <item>I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks, your loveliness and the hour of my death. O that I could have possession of them both in the same minute.</item>
        <item>I don't know anywhere where the people are hungrier for education than South Sudan.</item>
        <item>I've been in international competition, and now I know what the big boys can do. You don't go out and just run. There's an offense and a defense.</item>
        <item>The reason of the close concurrence between the individual's progress and that of the race appears, therefore, when we remember the dependence of each upon the other.</item>
        <item>It was important for us to be as supportive as our candidates and as our incumbent senators would have us be.</item>
        <item>The glow of one warm thought is to me worth more than money.</item>
        <item>At first everyone predicted that it would be impossible to hold these divergent people together, but aside from the skilled men, some of whom belonged to craft unions, comparatively few went back to the mills. And as a whole, the strike was conducted with little violence.</item>
        <item>Love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning.</item>
        <item>I get those fleeting, beautiful moments of inner peace and stillness - and then the other 23 hours and 45 minutes of the day, I'm a human trying to make it through in this world.</item>
        <item>The beautiful thing about when you go through a slide is that you learn from it. Not just saying that you learn from it, but applying the things that you have learned.</item>
        <item>I plan on having the credibility and integrity of being a part of an entertainment news program like 'E!,' in addition to being on the actor side as well.</item>
        <item>Today's youth are told to get rich or die trying and they really shouldn't take that attitude forward with them.</item>
        <item>Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.</item>
        <item>There was expectations that the fights there, the operation there might be extended for several months, even for several years. But within a few weeks it ended, because obviously the Taliban wasn't a real force.</item>
        <item>The worst government is the most moral. One composed of cynics is often very tolerant and humane. But when fanatics are on top there is no limit to oppression.</item>
        <item>As an actor, you want a director who makes you feel comfortable in a place that you can really create and try a lot of different things.</item>
        <item>All great deeds and all great thoughts have a ridiculous beginning. Great works are often born on a street corner or in a restaurant's revolving door.</item>
        <item>I write… sonnets… and writing sonnets is boring. You have to find rhymes; you have to write hendecasyllables; so after a while, I get bored and my drawer is overflowing with unfinished short poems.</item>
        <item>I believe that the people, instead of pretty lies, should be told the truth, no matter how ugly it may be. What can we do, destiny hasn't been kind to us; but, with the help of God, we will prevail.</item>
        <item>You're never guaranteed about next year. People ask what you think of next season, you have to seize the opportunities when they're in front of you.</item>
        <item>Recession is when a neighbor loses his job. Depression is when you lose yours.</item>
        <item>We didn't make no mistakes. We didn't make no mistakes.</item>
        <item>Inside me I'm Ghanaian, and I'm proud to be African. But of course I'm Italian. I was born in Italy. I've never been to Africa in my life, but I will go one day.</item>
        <item>Milosevic did not die in The Hague - he was killed in The Hague. But, he had managed to defend the national and state interests of Serbia and the Serb people, and everybody should be grateful to him for that.</item>
        <item>I had two sisters, and we would love to get dressed up and pretend that we were chic, sophisticated ladies. And I think that was a great sort of preparation, in a way.</item>
        <item>My life is full of drama, and I don't have time to worry about something as petty as what I look like.</item>
        <item>Animals are such agreeable friends - they ask no questions; they pass no criticisms.</item>
        <item>I think it's even harder because I think as always, Hollywood is sort of glamour central for the world, and the entire world looks to it for not only entertainment, but the whole idea of the youth factor and youth being sold to our culture via young actors and actresses.</item>
        <item>Everywhere the human soul stands between a hemisphere of light and another of darkness; on the confines of the two everlasting empires, necessity and free will.</item>
        <item>Adventure is not outside man; it is within.</item>
        <item>I'm not versed enough in constitutional law to run for office. I'd have to go back to school or something.</item>
        <item>Music creates a certain mood and then people dress accordingly. I think it's all quite closely intertwined.</item>
        <item>Innovation is the specific instrument of entrepreneurship. The act that endows resources with a new capacity to create wealth.</item>
        <item>Comedy is much more challenging, because you have to have the same level of belief but you have to make people laugh, and that's definitely a challenge.</item>
        <item>The root of the kingdom is in the state. The root of the state is in the family. The root of the family is in the person of its head.</item>
        <item>The word love has by no means the same sense for both sexes, and this is one cause of the serious misunderstandings that divide them.</item>
        <item>The golden opportunity you are seeking is in yourself. It is not in your environment; it is not in luck or chance, or the help of others; it is in yourself alone.</item>
        <item>Some people around you don't mean you good.</item>
        <item>I am not young enough to know everything.</item>

        <item>For me, my mother is everything.</item>
        <item>There were the people that believed in me when I was walking around Spanish Harlem, saying that I was going to be a Hollywood actress. They were like, 'Yeah, you could do it!'</item>
        <item>When we bring back with us the objects most dear, and find those we left unchanged, we are tempted to doubt the lapse of time; but one link in the chain of affection broken, and every thing seems altered.</item>
        <item>Successful people are always looking for opportunities to help others. Unsuccessful people are always asking, 'What's in it for me?'</item>
        <item>I have always been attracted to the cottage industry side of this business.</item>
        <item>When leading evangelicals say terrible things about Islam, evil things about Islam, terrible things about Muhammad, they ought to be ashamed of themselves.</item>
        <item>Success is never final, failure is never fatal. It's courage that counts.</item>
        <item>You can change a person's life in an instant; put him in a movie, and you start thinking differently, you want to be in another movie. It's like an addiction almost.</item>
        <item>I don't want to be involved in endless media gossip.</item>
        <item>Certain it is that their power increased always in an exact proportion to the weakness of the Caliphate, and, without doubt, in some of the most distracted periods of the Arabian rule, the Hebrew Princes rose into some degree of local and temporary importance.</item>
        <item>We work in the dark - we do what we can - we give what we have. Our doubt is our passion and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art.</item>
        <item>We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.</item>
        <item>My most brilliant achievement was my ability to be able to persuade my wife to marry me.</item>
        <item>He was the only person caught in the collapse, and afterward, most of his work was recovered too, and it is still spoken of, when it is noted, with high regard, though seldom played.</item>
        <item>It's a market economy. Apparently the demand for great coaches exceeds the supply, so of course the price of good coaches is going to be high.</item>
        <item>To forget oneself is to be happy.</item>
        <item>I think I definitely enjoy recording, but I think it's more fun to go out and perform live, because it's like instant gratification, you know? You feel the response immediately.</item>
        <item>They were looking for a stable, but we didn't have one. In fact, we weren't very stable ourselves.</item>
        <item>If you have nothing to hide, there is no reason not to be transparent.</item>
        <item>You know as well as I do that counterinsurgency is a very nuanced type of military operation.</item>
        <item>Food is a necessary component to life. People can live without Renoir, Mozart, Gaudi, Beckett, but they cannot live without food.</item>
        <item>I told everybody that I was going to be an actress in Hollywood one day. People looked at me like I was crazy.</item>
        <item>I would say the most satisfying thing actually is watching my three children each pick up on their own interests and work many more hours per week than most people that have jobs at trying to intelligently give away that money in fields that they particularly care about.</item>
        <item>There is nothing so skillful in its own defense as imperious pride.</item>
        <item>We shall meet again. I have believed in God. I obeyed the laws of war and was loyal to my flag.</item>
        <item>In Wales, singing and storytelling are party skills, not professions.</item>
        <item>If the king loves music, there is little wrong in the land.</item>
        <item>Anxiety is love's greatest killer. It makes others feel as you might when a drowning man holds on to you. You want to save him, but you know he will strangle you with his panic.</item>
        <item>I learned to approach racing like a game of billiards. If you bash the ball too hard, you get nowhere. As you handle the cue properly, you drive with more finesse.</item>
        <item>If you feel you have the right key, you try to make some phrase or sound that will fit.</item>
        <item>I like men who are more in their heads.</item>
        <item>Laughter is a way of really letting out all this pressure that you could face in your daily life in the suffering of your people, and comedy is almost like a medicine to your soul in a way.</item>
        <item>I've started looking at my own father a bit funny. He assures me, though, that I really am the son of a Scottish postman.</item>
        <item>There are two primary choices in life: to accept conditions as they exist, or accept the responsibility for changing them.</item>
        <item>I just knew that God wasn't there. He was a man on a throne in Heaven, so he was easy to forget.</item>
        <item>The public is wiser than the wisest critic.</item>
        <item>Modeling is always something I've really admired because I've seen my mum and sister do it.</item>
        <item>Writing in English is the most ingenious torture ever devised for sins committed in previous lives. The English reading public explains the reason why.</item>
        <item>Democracy, if it meant what our forefathers said, that would be great, but unfortunately it's been corrupted by this funding and funding of campaigns. There's a much better way to do it. There could be a small amount of money given by every taxpayer to be dedicated to candidates.</item>
        <item>All we are saying is give peace a chance.</item>
        <item>I was really fascinated by some of the things happening with Anonymous, the hackers group.

        <item>If I was a Greek citizen I'd be out there trying to bring down this monstrosity that has been put upon those people.</item>
        <item>It evolved from my experience in the fifties, growing up during the McCarthy era, and hearing a lot of assumptions that America was wonderful and Communism was terrible.</item>
        <item>I'm not shy or reclusive. I just spend my time with people rather than journalists.</item>
        <item>It is true we have won all our wars, but we have paid for them. We don't want victories anymore.</item>
        <item>South Carolina, as a matter of compromise, displays the Confederate flag on a flagpole in front of the state capitol. Because I grew up in the South and believe that the Confederate flag is a very divisive symbol, I have stated publicly a number of times that I believe that South Carolina should remove the flag from the state capitol grounds.</item>
        <item>I have no objection to well-written romance, but I'd read enough of it to know that that's not what I had written. I also knew that if it was sold as romance I'd never be reviewed by the 'New York Times' or any other literarily respectable newspaper - which is basically true, although the 'Washington Post' did get round to me eventually.</item>
        <item>What is wealth? A dream of fools.</item>
        <item>When I retired, I was at an in-between age. I wasn't a child anymore, I wasn't really a woman yet, and they weren't really writing scripts for that age.</item>
        <item>I've always wanted to be a fighter pilot. But I don't want to kill people. I'd hate to.</item>
        <item>Despite the barrage of information about me that is publicly available, I live a surprisingly private and anonymous life.</item>
        <item>I wouldn't want to try to adapt something of my own. It would be like going back to school and doing all my exams again.</item>
        <item>I think God just died of old age. And, when I realized that he wasn't any more, it didn't shock me. It seemed natural and right!</item>
        <item>Honestly, if the worst these people can say about me is that I'm gay, then I think I'll be fine. I can handle it.</item>
        <item>When people are in love, I don't see anything wrong with it in the world. If they choose to live their lives and get married, why should we interfere? A lot of people don't agree with me, but that's how I feel.</item>
        <item>It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed.</item>
        <item>I do think, oddly, that a comedic actor has a better chance of pulling off a dramatic role than a great dramatic actor has of being able to pull off a highly comedic role.</item>

        <item>I love books that give you space to climb inside there. And you have to run to keep up in places, and you have to fill in a lot of blanks yourself. So it almost becomes your story.</item>
        <item>We estimate that humanitarian agencies have access to about 350,000 vulnerable people in Darfur - only about one third of the estimated total population in need.</item>

        <item>When the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different: Liberty, sir, was the primary object.</item>
        <item>I've wanted somehow to convey to you the sensations - the atmospheric pressure, you might say - of what it is to be seriously a long-term prisoner in an American prison.</item>
        <item>We've been shooting the last two weeks with a lot of vampires. I don't want to give away too much, but if you've read the books, it's the standoff with lots of vampires in play. There's like 70 people going through the works at once. It's a little maddening, but fun. We shot pretty much the ending of the two movies the other day.</item>
        <item>Hunter can write a melody and stuff like that, but his forte is lyrics. He can write a serviceable melody to hang his lyrics on, and sometimes he comes up with something really nice.</item>
        <item>Some of these actresses or public personas who are very public about their disciplined diets, more power to them. I just don't see the point. I'm just not going to be one of those people photographed in a bikini where people are like, 'OMG, look at Amy!' I mean, it might be OMG, but not for the reasons I want.</item>
        <item>My Daddy was my hero. He was always there for me when I needed him. He listened to me and taught me so many things. But most of all he was fun.</item>
        <item>Our first thought is always for those on life's first rung, and how we might increase their chances of climbing.</item>
        <item>To tell you the truth, it's a complex piece, so I can't really answer your question at present.</item>
        <item>My extravagance is my garden - it's the first thing I look at every morning when I wake up. It gives me so much pleasure.</item>
        <item>That's really one of the things I love about video games. It's a whole new world every time you start.</item>
        <item>The E.U. initially decided to end the isolation of Turkish Cyprus, to balance the accession of Cyprus. But the E.U. has not carried through on its promise.</item>
        <item>In many ways, history is marked as 'before' and 'after' Rosa Parks. She sat down in order that we all might stand up, and the walls of segregation came down.</item>
        <item>I was born and raised in Ohio. During my childhood, I spent most of my time drawing and reading fairy tales and myths.</item>
        <item>Musicians tend to get bored playing the same thing over and over, so I think it's natural to experiment.</item>
        <item>People like to hear songs that they can dance to. Even if they're sitting, they like being made to want to dance and move. By me being a dancer, I know how I'd dance at certain tempos. I was always good at it.</item>
        <item>I always prefer to believe the best of everybody, it saves so much trouble.</item>
        <item>The more we have the less we own.</item>
        <item>I'm a big kid, I'm a kid at heart, so I still love the classic family films, such as the great Warner Bros film 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' - not the remake, but the original. It's still one of the best movies, hands down, ever made, and of course that goes back to the ingenuity of the characters and the storyline.</item>
        <item>I certainly couldn't run a big country house, nor could I organize the greatest show on earth.</item>
        <item>I wanted to buy a candle holder, but the store didn't have one. So I got a cake.</item>
        <item>I take some pains to learn the material beforehand. I have a bunch of tricks I use to try and hit the ground running. I write everything out. I take the text and I very methodically go through, and that tends to put it into my head a little bit more solidly than if I just glanced at it and hoped for the best.</item>
        <item>I tell my students, it's not difficult to identify with somebody like yourself, somebody next door who looks like you. What's more difficult is to identify with someone you don't see, who's very far away, who's a different color, who eats a different kind of food. When you begin to do that then literature is really performing its wonders.</item>
        <item>Too much mercy… often resulted in further crimes which were fatal to innocent victims who need not have been victims if justice had been put first and mercy second.</item>
        <item>Usually I play the bad guy role, a terrorist or someone.</item>
        <item>Good people are good because they've come to wisdom through failure. We get very little wisdom from success, you know.</item>
        <item>We actually have a real community of people doing useful things.</item>
        <item>There are a lot of things that frustrate me. I get frustrated when I have to wait at a red light.</item>
        <item>Over time, the welfare state has become dysfunctional in a surprising way. But in a way it became a victim of its own success: It became so successful at prolonging life, that it becomes financially unsustainable, unless you make major changes to things like retirement ages.</item>
        <item>The 20th century was a century in which human rights were infringed upon in numerous parts of the world, and Japan also bears responsibility in that regard. I believe that we have to look at our own history with humility and think about our responsibility.</item>
        <item>The mere thought hadn't even begun to speculate about the merest possibility of crossing my mind.</item>

        <item>I've worked in the prison system, on death row and maximum security. I did that work for six years. I've worked with some of the most difficult people in our society. Buddhism was accessible and helpful for these individuals.</item>
        <item>Without Hitler, the State of Israel probably would not exist today. To that extent he was probably the Jews' greatest friend.</item>

        <item>How many husbands have I had? You mean apart from my own?</item>
        <item>Most of you are so young you don't know who I am, and that's good.</item>
        <item>I do think Austin is a great town for writers; we have a lot of them here. But I grew up in Austin, and so I didn't move here because it was a creative mecca; I was just lucky to live here.</item>
        <item>I enjoyed reading and learning at school, and at university I enjoyed extending my reading and learning. Once I left Cambridge, I went to Yale as a fellow. I spent two years there. After that, George Gale made me literary editor of 'The Spectator.'</item>
        <item>Which form of proverb do you prefer Better late than never, or Better never than late?</item>
        <item>I TiVo 'CSI,' 'CSI: Miami,' 'Grey's Anatomy,' 'Young and The Restless' - my husband hates that one - and that's pretty much it.</item>
        <item>There's nothing like eavesdropping to show you that the world outside your head is different from the world inside your head.</item>
        <item>I only hope that we don't lose sight of one thing - that it was all started by a mouse.</item>
        <item>I understand all the problems for the Ministry of Defence, of course I do; working within a budget and trying to do so many things is not easy.</item>
        <item>I love good rock'n'roll, blues and jazz, gospel, and a little reggae.</item>
        <item>It's better when you have your wife with you, more fun.</item>
        <item>I'm not a wildly gifted person; I don't play an instrument or speak another language or have great accomplishments in another field, as many writers do. But writing feels natural to me; the act of it seems to free up my unconscious, so that sometimes I feel that I have access to more ideas and information than my conscious mind could think up.</item>
        <item>I understood right from the start that every set of library doors were the sort of magic portals that lead to other lands. My God, right within reach there were dinosaurs and planets and presidents and girl detectives!</item>
        <item>To be a fashion critic is easy because you just say, 'I love it, I hate it,' but life is more than love and hate.</item>
        <item>One of the very important characteristics of a student is to question. Let the students ask questions.</item>
        <item>The way is not in the sky. The way is in the heart.</item>

        <item>The defining function of the artist is to cherish consciousness.</item>
        <item>I like reading. I just hate school.</item>
        <item>Love without conversation is impossible.</item>
        <item>Friendship is held to be the severest test of character. It is easy, we think, to be loyal to a family and clan, whose blood is in your own veins.</item>
        <item>If you don't ever stop singing, your voice stays in shape. It's like the marathon runner. You've got to run, run, run to stay in shape.</item>
        <item>I loved 'The Pitts.' I just loved it.</item>
        <item>When I meet a girl, I just sort of do really over-exaggerated terrible dance moves… a lot of hip movements. I get them laughing, and get them to feel pity for me, and then they like me!</item>
        <item>I think music has the power to transform people, and in doing so, it has the power to transform situations - some large and some small.</item>
        <item>In Canada, we have so much land, so much space, and so few people.</item>
        <item>Acting is a cruel enough business. One minute everyone's going 'Hey!' and the next they're going 'Who?'. You certainly don't need people knowing your private business, especially if you want to come out with your head still attached.</item>
        <item>The secret of getting ahead is getting started.</item>
        <item>I love iTunes as much as anybody. It's very convenient and very easy. But there is nothing like the vibe that you get when you walk into a record store. And I think a lot of people are still thrilled to spend a half hour there and go through the bins and make some purchases.</item>
        <item>For me, I love the flavors of Southern food, and people usually think of Southern food as heavy and fattening, but it doesn't have to be.</item>
        <item>I started taking my fiance, Justin, to some red carpet events I would go to, and a bowtie is often something that was required. We came across a lot of stylish bowties. We liked playing dress up for these events and we thought it would be fun to start a line, but it was never a reality until recently.</item>
        <item>Governing isn't as easy as you think. Many of you have taken pledges that are contradictory - to balance the budget and cut taxes, for example. You must be honest about the numbers, since our annual deficit now exceeds all discretionary spending combined.</item>
        <item>There's so little money in my bank account, my scenic checks show a ghetto.</item>
        <item>It's not really the life of cooking that's hard - it's what you make of it and what level you push yourself to.</item>
        <item>Every Thanksgiving, we all write down three things we're thankful for and put them in a hat. Then we pass the hat around the dinner table and everyone has to guess who wrote what!</item>
        <item>A pound of pluck is worth a ton of luck.</item>
        <item>If you get anything creative going, then the work and play thing is the same thing, I feel.</item>
        <item>A friend of my mom's was a casting director so, really as kind of a lark, I had a couple of acting jobs that had just enough exposure to give me the option to continue if I wanted to. I followed through with it.</item>
        <item>Studies have shown that children are less likely to wake up to a horn than the sound of a mother's voice.</item>

        <item>If American politics are too dirty for women to take part in, there's something wrong with American politics.</item>
        <item>But I can tell that once, and if, and when this issue gets to be, under real terms, investigated, you will be seeing certain people that we know from this country standing trial; and they will be prosecuted criminally.</item>
        <item>I just don't want to live like I used to. And at some point, I'm going to put a gag order on myself in terms of talking about the past. I've got to slam the door and deal with the present and the future.</item>
        <item>It's appropriate to celebrate public service, and the thoughtful people who choose to serve. They symbolize what is good and decent about this historic citizen legislature, and we thank them.</item>
        <item>You can't even begin to understand biology, you can't understand life, unless you understand what it's all there for, how it arose - and that means evolution.</item>
        <item>I know I live a charmed, beautiful life and nobody wants to hear a celebrity whine. The last thing I want to do is complain; I love what I do and I know every job comes with a downside.</item>
        <item>My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was sixty. She's ninety-seven now, and we don't know where the hell she is.</item>
        <item>People wouldn't even go into science unless there was something much bigger to be discovered, something that is transcendent.</item>
        <item>I think that America has an obsession with history, really.</item>
        <item>If you want to beat me up, feel free. You cannot beat me up more than I have already beaten up myself.</item>
        <item>I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.</item>
        <item>It takes a lot of experience of life to see why some relationships last and others do not. But we do not have to wait for a crisis to get an idea of the future of a particular relationship. Our behavior in little every incidents tells us a great deal.</item>
        <item>I love fashion! I love clothes! I really like vintage clothes, so in my closet there's a lot of '50s stuff. I go to the stores and shop around.</item>
        <item>I chose to take the oath of office with my personal copy of the Bhagavad Gita because its teachings have inspired me to be a servant-leader, dedicating my life in the service of others and to my country.</item>
        <item>We ought to be beating our chests every day. We ought to look in the mirror, stick out our chests, suck in our bellies, and say, 'Damn, we're Americans,' and smile.</item>
        <item>Making a movie is still very difficult in Hollywood, regardless of what you have and what level you're at. It is a house of cards, and things have to perfectly align.</item>
        <item>I am going to do everything I can to clear my name.</item>
        <item>My family are observant Muslims, but I've come to the faith through an intellectual conviction, and that's something that they've taught me. It's never been forced upon me. They've given me a very strong identity as an Australian Muslim.</item>
        <item>Well, I'm… first and foremost I'm a theater guy and everything that I know comes from the theater.</item>

        <item>Fame is like a river, that beareth up things light and swollen, and drowns things weighty and solid.</item>
        <item>Man is lost and is wandering in a jungle where real values have no meaning. Real values can have meaning to man only when he steps on to the spiritual path, a path where negative emotions have no use.</item>
        <item>The brain's calculations do not require our conscious effort, only our attention and our openness to let the information through. Although the brain absorbs universes of information, little is admitted into normal consciousness.</item>
        <item>Ballyhoo is for your classic girl, who is fun and fearless. This is for the girl who is not afraid to dress fun.</item>
        <item>People need realness, reality. People can sense when someone is being pretentious or fake. It's because you feel it; you see it in someone's body language.</item>
        <item>A moral being is one who is capable of reflecting on his past actions and their motives - of approving of some and disapproving of others.</item>
        <item>My weapon of choice is the nunchuck. I do like the bo as well, which I use, the staff. I'm not so good with the sword, but I picked a lot of stuff up on 'Ninja 1' with the sword.</item>
        <item>Decide that you want it more than you are afraid of it.</item>
        <item>Molecular biology has routinely taken problematic things under its wing without altering core ideas.</item>

        <item>I started writing because I got so frustrated that there weren't enough plays that had roles for young black women in them.</item>
        <item>I've often said that the most important thing you can give your children is wings. Because, you're not gonna always be able to bring food to the nest. You're… sometimes… they're gonna have to be able to fly by themselves.</item>
        <item>As the biggest library if it is in disorder is not as useful as a small but well-arranged one, so you may accumulate a vast amount of knowledge but it will be of far less value than a much smaller amount if you have not thought it over for yourself.</item>
        <item>The lunch in a normal American restaurant is very problematic for me. I don't like to have hot food for lunch.</item>
        <item>It is conceivable that what is unified form to the author or composer may of necessity be formless to his audience.</item>
        <item>When I was six years old, my mother died; and then, for the first time, I learned, by the talk around me, that I was a slave.</item>
        <item>Space is as infinite as we can imagine, and expanding this perspective is what adjusts humankind focus on conquering our true enemies, the formidable foes: ignorance and limitation.</item>

        <item>Better be ignorant of a matter than half know it.</item>
        <item>Lofts are great. But with a home, there is a lot to be said for delineated space. To have the luxury of a little separate work space is huge - and to have the dream-sequence master bath.</item>
        <item>A lot of people watch 'Community,' but DVR viewings only count if you watch within a certain time.</item>
        <item>I do actually have a connection with James Herriot because we went to school in the same area. I went to Hillhead Primary School in the West End of Glasgow and he went to Hillhead Secondary.</item>

        <item>Sometimes I feel the only way I can get a major publisher interested in mental illness is if I find a character who has bipolar disorder and is also a love-sick vampire attending an English school called Hogwarts. But I'm not giving up.</item>

        <item>A waffle is like a pancake with a syrup trap.</item>
        <item>Not often do you approach a character where people know more about him than you do.</item>
        <item>The Hebrews have done more to civilize men than any other nation. If I were an atheist, and believed blind eternal fate, I should still believe that fate had ordained the Jews to be the most essential instrument for civilizing the nations.</item>
        <item>It's complicated, being an American, Having the money and the bad conscience, both at the same time.</item>

        <item>I've never been in any country for more than four years, and I'm learning different languages all the time. It gives you a different attitude.</item>

        <item>Prayer is an act of love; words are not needed. Even if sickness distracts from thoughts, all that is needed is the will to love.</item>
        <item>'Ugly Betty' has been four years of my life, important adolescent years. I think that all I've really known was getting pampered and interviewed and getting my picture taken.</item>
        <item>A highbrow is the kind of person who looks at a sausage and thinks of Picasso.</item>
        <item>I've loved thrillers and spy stories since I was a kid. It's probably not a bad rule of thumb to write the kinds of stories you love to read.</item>
        <item>If there's one thing I've always taken care of with my work, it's that it's never an advertisement for anything other than the work itself and for the people it's about - no 'Coca-Cola presents.'</item>

        <item>An Internet meme is a hijacking of the original idea.

        <item>It's hard to decide how to match words to music. It's not like it's twice the work. It's always difficult for me to explain to the composer what I'm looking for. I'm not a professional; I lack even basic knowledge about writing music.</item>

        <item>The only thing Martha and I have in common is that we both used to model. Martha Stewart is extremely talented. Her designs are picture perfect. Our philosophy is life is messy, and rather than being afraid of those messes we design products that work the way we live.</item>

        <item>Maybe if I could ever be a successful comedian then I could be an example that Christians can also have fun.</item>
        <item>I don't ever want it to be about me. A friend of mine told me, 'The difference between fame and notoriety is fame is when people know you, and notoriety is when people know your work.' The first one is not respectable, but the second one is, because that leaves a legacy.</item>

        <item>I really like Wisconsin. I enjoy it. I enjoy the people. I enjoy the fact that it's not L.A. or New York. And there's some sense of normalcy here - people having children in homes they can somewhat afford to live in.</item>
        <item>I don't know why people are so surprised by my live performances. My approach is so simple; every song I sing, every story I tell, every move I make, must move the audience to laughter, tears or inspiration. Otherwise, why should I do it?</item>

        <item>After graduating from flares and platforms in the early 1970s, I started drama school wearing a pair of khaki dungarees with one of my Dad's Army shirts, accessorised by a cat's basket doubling as a handbag. Very Lady Gaga.</item>
        <item>Where I am today… I still have my ups and downs, but I take it one day at a time and I just hope that I can be the best that I can possibly be, not only for myself, but also young people that are out there today that need someone to look up to.</item>
        <item>I would advise dancers, musicians and others in the entertainment industry to take up yoga, as it clears the mind and creates a sense of balance and stillness which is important for any performing artist.</item>
        <item>I suppose I have had more advantages and privileges than most of you, who are slaves have ever known, and I believe more than many white people have enjoyed, for which I desire to bless God, and pray that he may bless those who have given them to me.</item>

        <item>Ultimately, all human activities have as their goal the realization of happiness. Why, then, have we ended up producing the opposite result? Could the underlying cause be our failure to correctly understand the true nature of happiness?</item>

        <item>When your future arrives, will you blame your past?</item>

        <item>I am not struck so much by the diversity of testimony as by the many-sidedness of truth.</item>
        <item>I live a half mile from the San Andreas fault - a fact that bubbles up into my consciousness every time some other part of the world experiences an earthquake.

        <item>So, we're saying, if we can give developers and builders incentives to cut down on the regulatory barriers that are faced in this country, then we might be able to address the needs of affordable housing.</item>
        <item>Social advance depends as much upon the process through which it is secured as upon the result itself.</item>
        <item>Smoking calms me down. It's enjoyable. I don't want politicians deciding what is exciting in my life.</item>
        <item>I will not attack your doctrines nor your creeds if they accord liberty to me. If they hold thought to be dangerous - if they aver that doubt is a crime, then I attack them one and all, because they enslave the minds of men.</item>
        <item>I'm not trying to be new school and I'm not old school - I'm classic. There's a lot of new cars and there's a lot of old cars, but I'm just classic in doing what I do.</item>

        <item>I've only ever played 'God of War' while we were shooting it. I've seen a lot of the videos, but while we were shooting 'God of War,' they had a green room for the actors to hang out in, and they always had the newest game on the big screen. So we'd sit there playing 'God of War' to get us into the mood.</item>

        <item>What I love about 'The Chew' is that we have these celebrities come on, and you get to see them in a different light, cooking or enjoying food, when we usually don't see them in that setting.

        <item>I've been acting my whole life. I have this huge imagination! I'm a dancer and my mom's a dance teacher, and I was always performing and entertaining people.

        <item>A word of encouragement from a teacher to a child can change a life. A word of encouragement from a spouse can save a marriage. A word of encouragement from a leader can inspire a person to reach her potential.</item>
        <item>Some people see acting as a kind of stroll on the beach, and some people see it as a kind of skydive. And I've had lots of strolls on the beach in my life, so I'd like to do a skydive.</item>
        <item>We feel a lot of pressure about looking silly or appearing weak, whatever that means, or being a failure. You have to keep in your head: what's the worst that can happen?</item>
        <item>I suspect that many of the great cultural shifts that prepare the way for political change are largely aesthetic. A Buick radiator grille is as much a political statement as a Rolls Royce radiator grille, one enshrining a machine aesthetic driven by a populist optimism, the other enshrining a hierarchical and exclusive social order.</item>
        <item>I was overjoyed when I was offered the title role in 'Well Done Abba.' I was ready for the role even before I heard the story because you don't ask questions when it is Shyam Benegal's film. It is the chance of a lifetime.</item>

That was one of my most favorite creative experiences; we're all up at that commune, a small group of people. Everyone was funnier than the next. It was an amazing ensemble feeling. Everyone gave and took in the best way.</item>

        <item>Generally, you are held to a sound and that becomes your sound. That gets branded as your sound, and all the copycats start with it because the labels are looking for that sound.</item>
        <item>I don't work a five-day week as a rule, and I've managed to fill that time up. It hasn't been that hard. I volunteer at school. I'm working because I love it. Yet, I don't not envy women who have a stay-at-home job, because you miss stuff.</item>
        <item>When I got to Hollywood, at first I couldn't get a lot of jobs. So I grew a beard and look like a really bad Arab, and I started to get a lot of work because that's what they want.</item>
        <item>I think for me, as far as cooking, some of it came naturally just from watching my dad. My dad was more of the cook than my mom was, so it's just handing it down from generation to generation. I just love to cook and have fun.

        <item>And as I stumbled onto Eastern philosophy and Buddhism, it was the first time I had ever read any sort of philosophy that really made a tremendous amount of sense.

        <item>This may sound a little harsh, but I don't care about my career. Really, I don't like actors who are always planning what they're going to do next or always worrying about doing something that will go against the image they've created.

        <item>All the seven deadly sins are man's true nature. To be greedy. To be hateful. To have lust. Of course, you have to control them, but if you're made to feel guilty for being human, then you're going to be trapped in a never-ending sin-and-repent cycle that you can't escape from.</item>
        <item>I want to sing simple things for the simple lives of simple people.</item>
        <item>From your parents you learn love and laughter and how to put one foot before the other. But when books are opened you discover that you have wings.</item>
        <item>I think that's exactly what Silicon Valley was all about in those days. Let's do a startup in our parents' garage and try to create a business.</item>
        <item>Fallen leaves lying on the grass in the November sun bring more happiness than the daffodils.</item>
        <item>And what's great is, you know, while 'Mike and Molly' are working on their health, that's their flaw, the people that surround them are actually- that's the mess. Those two have it together the most.</item>
        <item>I do not follow the rules of fashion, and I don't like to be considered a man of the world of fashion. I like to call it the 'style industry' because we try to work on taste.</item>
        <item>New Orleans jazz is a complex and embracing art form that began about the same time as the blues and encompassed many of its excellences.</item>
        <item>The happiest people in the world are those who feel absolutely terrific about themselves, and this is the natural outgrowth of accepting total responsibility for every part of their life.</item>

        <item>Growing up with Jennifer Lopez and Salma Hayek - people who were always trying to do something else - I wanted to follow in their footsteps. They gave people a different perspective of how women were supposed to look like and be.</item>
        <item>It's like spicy food - sometimes you have to tone it down so more people can enjoy it.</item>
        <item>Disappointment over nationalistic authoritarian regimes may have contributed to the fact that today religion offers a new and subjectively more convincing language for old political orientations.</item>
        <item>I loved being in Close Encounters, just to watch Steven Spielberg working was exciting.</item>
        <item>I think controversy is not always a bad thing. Jesus was controversial. It's through controversy that people often wake up and smell the coffee and say, 'What's going on here? Do we need to rethink something here?'</item>
        <item>The power of imagination makes us infinite.</item>
        <item>Basically, at the very bottom of life, which seduces us all, there is only absurdity, and more absurdity. And maybe that's what gives us our joy for living, because the only thing that can defeat absurdity is lucidity.</item>
        <item>The dualism itself becomes a sort of presupposition or datum; its terms condition the further problem.</item>
        <item>I like the immediacy of blogs and the democratizing effects of letting millions of voices bloom on the Web.</item>
        <item>I believe that writing is derivative. I think good writing comes from good reading.</item>

        <item>When you work on anything, you want to find the range of impulses - which ones get portrayed is another question, but you want to have that complexity and that fullness, even if you're playing a cartoon character.</item>

        <item>First I lost my voice, then I lost my figure and then I lost Onassis.</item>
        <item>By reading the scriptures I am so renewed that all nature seems renewed around me and with me. The sky seems to be a pure, a cooler blue, the trees a deeper green. The whole world is charged with the glory of God and I feel fire and music under my feet.</item>

        <item>Sad people dislike the happy, and the happy the sad; the quick thinking the sedate, and the careless the busy and industrious.</item>
        <item>My goal is to get home every day in time for dinner with the family - and then we play with the kids for a while, and then I go to bed around the time they do and sleep from nine to three or nine to four. It's the same six hours everyone else gets. I'd just rather do my e-mails and my reading in the morning rather than late at night, that's all.</item>

        <item>My all-time heroes are Thurgood Marshall and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., two men who had to really work to achieve what they did. And I had the privilege of meeting them both.</item>
        <item>The word 'retirement' doesn't really sit well with me. There comes a time when you reach a position in society or culture where people will not let you retire. You can say, 'Alright, I'm going to hang up my guitar,' but people will still not let you retire.</item>
        <item>Wikipedia has experienced censorship at the hands of industry groups and governments, and we are - increasingly, I think - seeing important decisions made by unaccountable, non-transparent corporate players, a shift from the open web to mobile walled gardens, and a shift from the production-based Internet to one that's consumption-based.</item>
        <item>There was a period in my life when I would say no, and I didn't know why I was saying no. In most cases, it was out of fear, just trying to be safe. Because 'no' will keep you safe. 'No' won't draw attention to you. But all the cool things are on the other side of 'Yes, And.'</item>

        <item>The old cathedrals are good, but the great blue dome that hangs over everything is better.</item>
        <item>In the twentieth century our highest praise is to call the Bible “The World's Best Seller.” And it has come to be more and more difficult to say whether we think it is a best seller because it is great, or vice versa.</item>
        <item>No one was ever great without some portion of divine inspiration.</item>
        <item>Creative people don't behave very well generally. If you're looking for examples of good relationships in show business, you're gonna be depressed real fast. I don't have time for anything else right now but work and my daughter. She's my first priority.</item>
        <item>The brank, or scold's bridle, was unknown in America in its English shape: though from colonial records we learn that scolding women were far too plentiful, and were gagged for that annoying and irritating habit.</item>
        <item>If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred.</item>
        <item>I've also learned to no longer feel guilty if I'm invited out and don't want to go. If I start to say to myself, 'What's wrong with you that you're staying in five nights in a row to watch 'Forensic Files' instead of going out with your friends' I remind myself that it's what I need to do for myself at that point.</item>

        <item>The pictures are created by the listener, with a little help from the broadcaster. The pictures are perfect. If you're showing pictures, different things in that picture can distract from the spoken word.</item>
        <item>Those old adages - you attract more with honey; do unto others - are true. You can get attention by being acerbic or mean or making a bizarre comment.

        <item>In the last analysis, the individual person is responsible for living his own life and for 'finding himself.' If he persists in shifting his responsibility to somebody else, he fails to find out the meaning of his own existence.</item>

        <item>It is one thing for the human mind to extract from the phenomena of nature the laws which it has itself put into them; it may be a far harder thing to extract laws over which it has no control.</item>
        <item>As long as I live, I will never forget that day 21 years ago when I raised my hand and took the oath of citizenship. Do you know how proud I was? I was so proud that I walked around with an American flag around my shoulders all day long.</item>
        <item>I love test screenings. Some directors don't, I know. But I love it. I think it's because I come from the theatre and in the theatre, previews are where you really have to listen to the audience and really feel how they're responding. I found our test screenings incredibly useful.</item>
        <item>I am an American. I adore Britain and have a strong English half, but my roots are here in the U.S. - it is not a matter of choice; it is simply fact.</item>
        <item>I just think it's fun to remind people that good television has exited and it can exist again and just to give them pleasure and enjoy it and make them laugh.</item>
        <item>If you made a list of reasons why any couple got married, and another list of the reasons for their divorce, you'd have a hell of a lot of overlapping.</item>
        <item>If you put a ten dollar bill under the rug instead of spending it, that is capital formation. It represents ten dollars' worth of something that might have been immediately consumed, but wasn't.</item>

        <item>I'm a huge Emile Zola fan, and when Bill Gallagher said he was writing a new character for 'The Paradise' and had me in mind for the role, I knew I wanted to play Tom Weston before I'd even read a word of the script.</item>
        <item>The ideal American type is perfectly expressed by the Protestant, individualist, anti-conformist, and this is the type that is in the process of disappearing. In reality there are few left.</item>
        <item>I've always said that racing in New York is performing on the big stage.</item>
        <item>In America, I am brown; I'm 'of colour', so I would be offered Latin roles, and I've fought against that. I don't want to be put in a category, to be just offered the same sort of thing. For me, it's all about different roles, telling the stories of the great writers.</item>
        <item>I have been very fortunate in my life. I think I have an angel that is always with me. Good projects always come to me.</item>

        <item>It is not that the child lives in a world of imagination, but that the child within us survives and starts into life only at rare moments of recollection, which makes us believe, and it is not true, that, as children, we were imaginative?</item>

        <item>The burden of originality is one that most people don't want to accept. They'd rather sit in front of the TV and let that tell them what they're supposed to like, what they're supposed to buy, and what they're supposed to laugh at.</item>
        <item>We expect President Bush to implement his own vision of a two-state solution, the birth of the Palestinian State and the ending of the occupation that started in 1967.</item>
        <item>I love my family, my wife, my kids, my dogs, my home, my life. I am a very happy and contented man.</item>
        <item>People are broad-minded. They'll accept the fact that a person can be an alcoholic, a dope fiend, a wife beater and even a newspaperman, but if a man doesn't drive, there's something wrong with him.</item>
        <item>If I look back, my mother was always out. I can remember the perfume and her scarlet chiffon dress and crystal beads, going to a party. She used to play her violin at restaurants later on in life and at old people's homes. She loved the races, which she used to take me to as a child: our carpets were bought with her winnings. Loved her chickens.</item>
        <item>People who put themselves on the line and sacrifice their own safety for the greater good and for others, and anyone in any profession whose concern is the welfare for other people instead of the individual, are inspiring and important.</item>
        <item>The theatre is a gross art, built in sweeps and over-emphasis. Compromise is its second name.</item>
        <item>I'm not much of a famous-person friend. I've hung out with Brooke Shields and I don't think I've ever seen that kind of pure face recognition, but I keep a low profile.</item>

        <item>The point of theatre is transformation: to make an extraordinary event out of ordinary material right in front of an audience's eyes. Where the germ of the idea came from is pretty much irrelevant. What matters to every theatre maker I know is speaking clearly to the audience 'right now.'</item>

        <item>Life is lost at finding itself all alone. Mere egoism is a labyrinth.… Really to live is to be directed towards something, to progress towards a goal.</item>
        <item>The only thing that I miss lately in all music is somebody that will put out a melody that you can whistle. It doesn't seem like there's anything happening like that.</item>
        <item>I've worked on all sorts of things, like the sci-fi stuff for Vin Diesel, where the script is numbered and is in unphotocopy-able colours and your name is stamped into every page. And it doesn't really help because it creates a false sense of specialness about the thing.</item>
        <item>I'm going to North Pole to help out Santa this year.</item>
        <item>The golden hour of invention must terminate like other hours, and when the man of genius returns to the cares, the duties, the vexations, and the amusements of life, his companions behold him as one of themselves - the creature of habits and infirmities.</item>
        <item>Often times, I'm surprised by what I'm writing or what I'm playing, and then that inspires me to keep going with it, so it ends up being a very adventurous process.</item>

        <item>I think it takes a strong man to be in a relationship with a strong woman. A lot of people hear the word 'diva' and think of it as a negative. I see it as a positive. I want somebody who knows what they want out of life and isn't afraid to show it.</item>
        <item>I watch every 'Real Housewives' franchise there is.</item>
        <item>I really tried out for the part of Harry Potter, but they ended up picking me for the part of the enemy of Harry.

        <item>I needed to take a break from performing, and from the Peas, to be happy. I craved female time, and time with my husband to feed my soul. My life now is about being balanced. I'm passionate about work and working out, seeing friends and family, and letting my hair down once in a while.</item>

        <item>Why not mix this and that? If soy goes well with fish, how come no one does beef carpaccio with soy? Why do we have such a taste and not another? It's all about culture. There is something, however, that I really don't like: bell peppers.</item>
        <item>I fell in love with acting, just going to a lot of plays. My parents went to a lot of plays, and I went to a lot of schools that would get plays for kids.</item>
        <item>Turkey is fine, but if I don't have the sides, forget about it. And cornbread stuffing is at the center of my plate. I will have about six sides and then a little bit of turkey and gravy.</item>
        <item>The Christian response is contained in these two fundamental dogmas: that of the Trinity and that of the Incarnation. In the trinitarian dogma God is one, good, true, and beautiful because he is essentially Love, and Love supposes the one, the other, and their unity.</item>

        <item>Having a child makes you strong and gives you chutzpah.
